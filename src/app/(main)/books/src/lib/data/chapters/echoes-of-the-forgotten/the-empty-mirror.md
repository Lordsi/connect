# Chapter 1: The Empty Mirror

The first thing she noticed was the silence.

Not the absence of sound—cars still hummed outside, pigeons still cooed on the ledge—but the kind of silence that lives inside you. The kind that makes you reach for something you can't quite name, and find nothing there.

Lena stared at her reflection in the bathroom mirror. *Who am I?* The question had become her morning ritual, as automatic as brushing her teeth. Some days, she almost remembered something. A flicker of laughter. The smell of rain on pavement. A hand reaching for hers.

Then nothing.

*Three months earlier*, the doctors had said, *you were found in the park. No identification. No memory of how you got there.*

They'd run tests. Scans. Hours of questions. The diagnosis: acute retrograde amnesia. Possibly trauma-induced. Possibly something else—their eyes had shifted when she asked what "else" meant.

The knock at the door pulled her back.

"Lena? You have a visitor."

She wiped her hands on the towel and stepped into the hallway. Through the frosted glass of the front door, she could make out a silhouette. Tall. Holding something.

When she opened the door, the woman on the other side was holding a single white envelope.

"My name is Dr. Mirielle Chen," she said. "I think I know what happened to you. And I think you can help me find someone who's been missing for a very long time."

Lena's heart did something strange. It didn't beat faster. It *remembered*.

"Come in," she said.
